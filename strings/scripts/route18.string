Hello, nice to meet you.\p...\n...\pI'm a meteorologist from the Hoenn\nregion.\pWe've been noticing temporary and\nisolated cases of droughts and\lheavy rains there lately so I came\lhere to study this region's\lcurrent weather patterns to see\lif we can find some meaningful\lcorrelation.\pThough from everything that I've\nseen so far, the weather has been\lrelatively stable, which bode well\lfor our research.
