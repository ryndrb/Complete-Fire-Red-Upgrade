#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Rival_2
Yes, thank you!\nPlease excuse us.\pCome on.\nLet's go thank gramps.

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Rival_3
I'll be waiting in front of the\nPok\emon Research Lab.

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_May_2
Oh! Wait!\nI've gotta go home first.

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_May_3
Thanks for having us over!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_2
My, my, [PLAYER].\pPok\emon battles are so lively,\naren't they?\pI could hear the Pok\emon's cries\nclear down here!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_3
Hm. That sure reminded me of my\nfirst Pok\emon battle!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_4
Oh, and you know? After a battle,\nyou need to rest your Pok\emon!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_5
Your Pok\emon is looking great!\pNow, if you're going out, don't\nforget your DexNav!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_PlayerObtainedDexNav
[PLAYER] obtained the DexNav!\pPress [START_BUTTON] and [DPAD_RIGHT] to access.

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_6
You're going to thank the\nprofessor too, right?\lBetter get going, honey!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_TakeABreak
Phew! I'm taking a little break\nfrom cleaning.\pYou and your Pok\emon should take a\nbreak.\pGood trainers don't push their\nPok\emon too hard.

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Leaving_Mom_AllBetterNow
You and your Pok\emon should all be\nfilled with energy again!\lNow you can go anywhere!

#org @gText_Pallet_Town_Player_House_1F_Mom_WonderWhere
I wonder where you'll go next and\nwhat kind of Pok\emon you'll meet.
